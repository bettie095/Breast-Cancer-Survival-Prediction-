# Breast-Cancer-Survival-Prediction-
Breast cancer survival prediction with machine learning
Breast cancer originates in your breast tissue. It occurs when breast cells mutate (change) and grow out of control, creating a mass of tissue (tumor). Like other cancers, breast cancer can invade and grow into the tissue surrounding your breast. It can also travel to other parts of your body and form new tumors. When this happens, itâ€™s called metastasis. It is the second leading cause of death in women.
